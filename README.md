# General Input
This is a script that you can use in your games to get ANY user input on the keyboard without the need of defining every key. The script sends an event where the key-press is registered and you can subscribe to it with either a char value or an int (depending on what user pressed). 
NOTE: script is not usable for any string like key (like Escape, Control etc.). It works just for single character keys. To have any other string like key detected you need to define it in the appropiate place (instructions in the script). 
Enjoy!
